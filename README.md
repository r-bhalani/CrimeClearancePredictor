# Crime Clearance Predictor

Takes in the publicly available Austin Crime database entries over the past year and uses multiple different models to try and predict whether a crime will be cleared or not, given the features.

This can be used to check discrimination against particular neighborhoods and counties (EX: if certain areas are over or underpatrolled, if certain crimes are being disregarded completely, etc.), as well as be used to redirect police efforts to the reported crimes that aren't getting as much attention, and have a lower rate of clearance overall.
